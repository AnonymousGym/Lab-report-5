# __Lab Report 4__

First, I ran the bash script with both Joe's version of MarkdownParse and my own MarkdownParse using the following command:

```
time bash script.sh>results.txt
```
Now I have two results.txt. I use the command to compare two results.txt:

```
diff results.txt resultsOld.txt
```
